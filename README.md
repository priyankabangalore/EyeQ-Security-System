### Description
Our CS3307 final project is a security system hosted on a website. The site allows group 3 members to view live footage from a camera connected to a Rasberry Pi, check in/check out of the recorded area, display and update the user log with users' check-in/check-out timestamps and status, and display the local weather information that is read by a temperature and humidity sensor connected to a Raspberry Pi.

### Using the Application

1. Compile the application with line:

`make`

2. Open the following site on your browser:

http://0.0.0.0:9000


> **_NOTE:_**  In order to run the application, you are required to download Wt (can be found here: https://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt/download), and have access to the Raspberry Pi that is connected to our camera and temperature sensor.


### User Notes
Unfortunately, our camera's quality is not clear enough to scan our group member QR codes to update the user log, however we do have the working code for the QR code generator/scanner submitted to demo.
